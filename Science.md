1.  The Earth is **4**2 orders of magnitude (based on powers of ten) larger than the Planck Length (in case you dont know what that is, 
it is the smallest length that humans have been able to measure; all below the Planck Length is impossible to measure because time and 
space merge, and relativity ceases to be the rule. The Planck Length is 1 x 10-35m).

2.  The angle at which light reflects off of water to create a rainbow is **42** degrees.

3.  A **4**2 mile per hour wind brought down the original Tacoma bridge in the state of Washington in the 1930's.

4.  Convert the letters of the word "Iron sulfide" into numbers of the alphabet. (Iron sulfide being (for the record) the true name of 
fools gold.) I.e:

```  
    I R  O  N  S  U  L  F I D E
    9 18 15 14 19 21 12 6 9 4 5
```

Now then, Adding up the first 3 digits yields a total of **42**. Adding up the next 3 digits makes 54, which is what **42** would be in
base 10, if **42** was originally written as base 13 (The significance of which is widely known). Adding up the rest gets you 36, which 
is **42** written in base 12.

5.  An interesting and oft-cited factoid states that when asked to choose a random number between 1 and 20, 17 is the number most often 
chosen. A quick examination reveals the following:

```
    42 = 7 * 2 * 3
    17 = 7 * 2 + 3
```

6.  *"The Sri Yantra is drawn from nine triangles, four pointed downward and five pointed upward, thus forming **42** (6x7)sic triangular 
fragments around a central triangle. There is probably no other set of triangles which interlock with such integral perfection."* from 
"Sacred Geometry" Lawlor R., Thames and Hudson NY,1982 p.9.

7.  **42** is the natural vibration frequency of human DNA.

8.  **42** is the natural vibration frequency of white mouse DNA.

9.  ZOCOR, a new cholesterol drug, was responsible for saving the life of **42**% of the people who took it in a 5 year study.

13. Professor S. A. Jordan who was working with the Smithsonian Institute around 1909 supposedly discovered EGYPTIAN artifacts in 
the Grand Canyon in an area called AG9, approximately **42** miles up the river from the El Tovar canyon. This area has evidently
been off-limits to the public for about 65 years! This find was reported to have been made by G. E. Kincaid on a boat expedition down
the Colorado River financed by the Smithsonian. -- from the front page of "The Phoenix Gazette" dated April 5th, 1909. The article was
entitled "EXPLORATIONS IN GRAND CANYON", subtitled "Mysteries of Immense Rich Cavern Being Brought to Light...JORDAN IS ENTHUSED...
Remarkable Finds Indicate Ancient People Migrated From Orient."

14. The total number of dots on a pair of dice is **42**.

15. **42** is 4 tens and 2 ones. 4 is the only perfect number (the number is a perfect square AND it is the only number to have the 
same number of letters as the number represents) 2 squared is 4, the perfect number.

16. Take ANY number, square its digits, and then add them up. Do the same thing with the answer. If you keep doing this indefinitely 
your final answer will either be a 1, or you'll enter a loop of solutions that -culminate- with the number **42**.

17. The Department of Mathematics at the Muenster-University are most interested in the relation between the numbers **42** and 17. 
Here some examples:

    - the 17th prime number is 59, and this is the sum of 17 and 42.
    - If dig(n) means the sum of the digits of n, there are numbers with
```
        dig(n) + (dig(n) + 1) = n
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (we call them 'additive dig-numbers') and there are numbers with

```
        dig(n)*(dig(n) + 1) = n
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (the so called 'multiplicative dig-numbers') You can show that there is only one 'additive dig-number':

```
        17 = (1 + 7) + ((1 + 7) + 1)
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You can also show that there are only four 'multiplicative dig-numbers':

```
        12  = (1 + 2) * ((1 + 2) + 1)
        42  = (4 + 2) * ((4 + 2) + 1)
        90  = (9 + 0) * ((9 + 0) + 1)
        156 = (1 + 5 + 6) * ((1 + 5 + 6) + 1)
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And you see: **42** is one of them.
        
18. **42** is the number of the beast

```
    6 * 6 + 6 = 42
```

19. FISH = **42**

    6 + 9 + 19 + 8 = 42
```

23. The element Molybdenum is vital for plant life on earth. The Atomic Number of Molybdenum is **42**.

24. 5 + 4 (The parts from 54) = 9; 4 + 2 (The parts from **42**) = 6 "What do you get if you multiply 6 by 9?". The answer is all yours.

25. 1932 Is the year when Ford and Arthur return to the present in "Life, the Universe..." and it's also the day that the Vogons came to 
the earth. Therefore: 1986 (The year of the Copyright) - 54 = 1932!

26. From Nicholas E. Scripture: 50 Mathematical Puzzles and Oddities, Faber and Faber, London,1963, p.47, chapter "Oddments in Algebra", No. 30:

>    The problem is: Prove that for any value of 'n', as long as it is a whole number, (n ^ 7 - n) must always be a multiple of 42.

27. **4^2** = 2^4. Other than 24, this is the only non-palindromic two-digit number for which that is true.

28. If you assign the alphabetical value of to the letters of the words: BIG BANG ( or GNAB GIB ) you get

```
    2 + 9 + 7 + 2 + 1 + 14 + 7
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; which equals to, indeed, **42**.

32. The maximum temperature in degrees Celsius a human can survive in case of a disease is (of course) **42** degrees Celsius.

33. The REAL Hubble is (d/s) distance over speed of galaxies. As we cannot measure the speed accurately, the Constant is not known 
but scientists think it is betwixt 100 and 40, therefore it could be **forty-two**.

34. **42** is the Number of Great Lakes areas Of Concern.

35. If you take the number 'PI' as 3.14, and multiply the whole part (3) by the decimal part (14), then you get 3 x 14 = **42**.

36. The Specific heat capacity of water is **42**00 J/kg oC (Jewls/Kilograms x degrees Celsius).

37. If you drilled a hole through the Earth from one point to another, and that hole was frictionless, it would take **42** minutes 
for gravity to move you from you side of the tunnel to the other. That also goes for satellites orbiting the Earth with only gravity moving them.

38. The galaxy M84 (Messier Catalog) is **42** x 106 light years distant. It is an elliptical galaxy in Virgo with a diameter of 25,000 
light years.

39. Two physical constants in the universe are the speed of light and the diameter of a proton. It takes light 10 to the minus **42**nd power 
seconds to cross the diameter of a proton.

40. Aloutte, Canada's first artificial space satellite was **4**2 inches in diameter.

41. The Earth is sometimes referred to as the third stone (or rock, if you're a Jimi Hendrix fan) from the sun. A stone (British measurement
system) is 14 pounds, so we have

```

```

```
    2 4 2 4 2 * + * +
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; evaluates to **42**! (This, of course, is closely related to the fact that the binary 
number system, 101010 means **42**, 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or that in base 4, 222 means **42**).

56. Check

```    
    SQRT(41 * 42 + SQRT(41 * 42 + SQRT(41 * 42 + SQRT(...)))) = 42
```    

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; where

>        "If a certain number, two-thirds of it, half of it, and a seventh of it are added together, the result is 97."

    The number, of course, is **42**.
    
```    
    x + 2x/3 + x/2 + x/7 = 97 --> x = 42
``` 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This was derived from an 8th grade Addison-Wesley Algebra book, page 444.
